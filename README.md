# Overview

# UX

## Development
The development of this website started with getting a feel for how that could manage to get colors to race each other, and the logical thing was gravity simulated with a progressbar that goes for 10% to 100%. And for the user to be able to choose which color to race with, and how many tries to try to get it the highest score possible.

## Strategy
To achieve this the developer have to first learn how to do a progressbar and how to control it's movements with control, once that is achieved the developer need a way to randomize the movement of the progress bar and how to get so there is always one winner and no one with the same number. 

After that it's straight forward on just placing buttons and get them to control first, how many rounds there is to be played. After that which color to be raced and a loading phase where you have to wait until the race is over. And then start the whole thing over until the chosen number of rounds is achieved so we can get a latest score and possible a high score if that was achieved.

## Scope
To achieve the scope of this project the game has to have these criteria:
- Instructions how to play the game
- Intuitive design on how and where to press to progress through the game
- Feedback on when you press something, so you know you picked the right thing
- Alerts if something the user did in advance, and how to guide them to the right path
- The achievement when the user finished the game, high score and a latest score

Onces these criteria has been meet the game will function well and have achieved the purpose.

## Structure
First the user will arrive at the landing page which you are greeted with the instructions how to play the game, and blinking buttons where you are suppose to press to go about the game.

Each action taken will be meet with an appropriated action to progress the game.


## Skeleton
The skeleton was made using <a href="#" title="Link to Balsamiq website">Balsamiq</a>

## Surface
The surface was made using the skeleton, just with some better graphics. 

## Changes during the design process
The surface was changed a lot during the development of this project due to feedback from mentor and family, for example the game lacked a goal at first. That came to mind quite quickly after the skeleton was made and what came to be the basic coding of the game. 

The game needed to have a goal, which was declared to be a high score and a latest score. To let the user see what their recent achievements had been, and a way to let the user choose the number of difficulty to gain a higher score which introduced the round selection. After those changes the user feedback needed a simpler way to go about the game which lead to flashing buttons to guide the user towards pressing the right button at the right time.
