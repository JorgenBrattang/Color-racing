## Bug reports
The developer encounter a number of bugs throughout the development of this game, there were hurdles to overcome but those were fixed with either help from tutors, slack community or researching the internet.

A few worth mentioning:
- When starting the race, the colors would not start onces pressed.
    - Solution the progress bar was not working properly, which gave the if statement false information.
- Using the same button twice for different purpose, this gave the developer a headache.
    - Solutions changing the ID's and using if statements to check for information given and not given.
- Resizing the window for horizontal and portrait mode, this gave an unsuspected and unsolved bug within the inspect window in Chrome. As mentioned in Unfixed Bugs within the <a href="https://github.com/JorgenBrattang/color-racing/blob/main/README.md">README.md</a>
